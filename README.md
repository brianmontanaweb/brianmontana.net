Source for personal site leveraging modern technology stack with a retro design. Hand crafted locally sourced artisanal SVGs.

* Define js and scss/css linters
* Build rest of 3D SVG model
* Check when portrait or landscape is defined before switching how to rotate the 3D model, maybe a reset orientation button
